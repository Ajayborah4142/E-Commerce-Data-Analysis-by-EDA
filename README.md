# E-Commerce-Data-Analysis-by-EDA
This project analyzes customer feedback data to uncover key patterns in satisfaction and dissatisfaction. The goal is to understand what customers value most (e.g., easy ordering, product quality, timely delivery) and identify recurring pain points (e.g., missing items, packaging issues, delivery behavior). By leveraging text analysis and categorization of feedback, the project provides actionable insights that can help businesses improve service quality, enhance customer experience, and boost retention.
